# Text Editor Project

Welcome to the **Text Editor** project! This is a lightweight, feature-rich text editor inspired by Microsoft Word. It provides all the essential tools for creating, editing, and formatting documents, powered by the **TinyMCE API**. Whether you're drafting a simple note or a complex document, this editor has you covered.

## Features
- **Rich Text Editing**: Bold, italics, underline, bullet points, numbering, and more.
- **TinyMCE Integration**: Utilizes the TinyMCE API for a seamless editing experience.
- **Database Connectivity**: Save and retrieve documents from a database.
- **Easy Setup**: Configure your API key and database connection in just a few steps.

## How It Works

This project uses the **TinyMCE API** to provide a rich text editing interface. The API key is free for a 7-day trial (no credit card required). Once you replace the default API key with your own, you can connect the editor to a database by configuring the `appsettings.json` file. The project uses a **NuGet Package Manager Console** to update the database schema and store/retrieve documents.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **TinyMCE API Key**: Get a free API key from [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/).
2. **.NET SDK**: Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed.
3. **Database**: Set up a local or remote database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL).
4. **NuGet Package Manager**: Ensure you have NuGet installed in your development environment.
