Text Editor Project
Welcome to the Text Editor project! This is a lightweight, feature-rich text editor inspired by Microsoft Word. It provides all the essential tools for creating, editing, and formatting documents, powered by the TinyMCE API. Whether you're drafting a simple note or a complex document, this editor has you covered.

Features
Rich Text Editing: Bold, italics, underline, bullet points, numbering, and more.

TinyMCE Integration: Utilizes the TinyMCE API for a seamless editing experience.

Database Connectivity: Save and retrieve documents from a database.

Easy Setup: Configure your API key and database connection in just a few steps.

How It Works
This project uses the TinyMCE API to provide a rich text editing interface. The API key is free for a 7-day trial (no credit card required). Once you replace the default API key with your own, you can connect the editor to a database by configuring the appsettings.json file. The project uses a NuGet Package Manager Console to update the database schema and store/retrieve documents.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

TinyMCE API Key: Get a free API key from TinyMCE.

.NET SDK: Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed.

Database: Set up a local or remote database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL).

NuGet Package Manager: Ensure you have NuGet installed in your development environment.
